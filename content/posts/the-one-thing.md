[The One Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results by Gary Keller](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16256798-the-one-thing)

## Notes

### TL;DR

Useful reminders about focus, habits, and time-blocking; packaged as a single mantra (“the ONE thing”) with sticky quotes and tidy charts. But it’s mostly standard self-help (80/20, willpower as a finite resource, habits > discipline) wearing a new hat.

If you’re optimization-minded, you’ll get more durable leverage from **Kaizen** case studies ([Toyota Production System](https://global.toyota/en/company/vision-and-philosophy/production-system/); small improvements compounded daily) than from a rebrand of basics.

---

### The Core Idea

- Ask the focusing question: _What’s the ONE thing I can do such that by doing it everything else becomes easier or unnecessary?_
  - Strategy: results are **sequential**, not simultaneous (go small → go deep).
- Practice it like an operator: short success list (not a 40-item todo), **time-block mornings** in four-hour chunks, defend the block like it’s a board meeting.

---

### Key Points

- **Not everything matters equally** (Pareto); say “no” until the leveraged task is done (no “check-off” dopamine loops).
- **Multitasking = context switching with fees** (time, errors, stress); single-thread the important thing.
- **Habits beat “discipline”** (one habit at a time; ~66 days to automaticity; compounding lives here).
- **Willpower is fuel** (finite; put deep work early).
- **Time-blocking = receipts** (your calendar is your priorities, not your inbox).
- **Four thieves** to watch:
  1.  inability to say no
  2.  fear of chaos
  3.  poor health habits
  4.  unsupportive environment

---

### If you like the _message_, upgrade the _method_ (Kaizen > mantra)

- **Kaizen** (continuous improvement) gives the _same_ end-state:
- focus → small wins → compounding—but makes it **auditable**:
  - _Standard work_ (short success list, but written and shared).
  - _Obeya / daily huddles_ (time-blocks that the team can see—and protect).
  - _Gemba + 5 Whys_ (root-cause, not “try harder”).
  - _Pull systems_ (limit WIP (Work In Progress); kill context switching at the source).
- One Thing mapping to Kaizen:
  - success list → **standard work**
  - time-block → **obeya / huddle cadence**
  - four thieves → **waste categories + environment design**

## Personal Takeaways

1. **Design the first domino, explicitly.** Write it; block it; close the door. No dashboards before the domino.
2. **Short list; long block.** One item that moves the metric; four hours of protected time; calendar or it didn’t happen.
3. **One habit per quarter.** Build to automaticity (~66 days), then stack (less hustle; more compounding).
4. **Engineer the defaults.** Fewer tabs; fewer meetings; fewer open loops. Make the productive path the _easy_ path.

## Final Thought

If you’re early in your craft, this is a tidy on-ramp to focus and habit-building. If you already run on ROI, SOPs, and measurable throughput, it’s a reminder; useful, but not novel. Solid quotes; light scaffolding. For depth, study **Kaizen** cases; for daily rhythm, keep the focusing question and the four-hour block.
