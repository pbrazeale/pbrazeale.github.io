## TL;DR

**Rating:** ★★★★★ (5/5)

**Who should read this:** leaders; tech folks who live in trade-offs (PMs, staff+ engineers, founders); anyone tired of “strategy” as vibes and slideware.

I didn’t expect a field manual, but I got one!

Rich Horwath’s _Deep Dive_ is a compact, repeatable way to think (and act) strategically, without the usual MBA jargon. It’s pragmatic; it’s visual; it insists on **choices** (what you _won’t_ do matters as much as what you _will_ do).

Strategy, per Horwath, isn’t a once-a-year retreat. It’s a daily discipline:

- **generate insight → allocate scarce resources → translate into action**

## The big idea

- **Strategy ≠ aspiration/best practices/caution.** Goals and “we should be more like X” are not a strategy; neither is avoiding hard trade-offs. Strategy is _“the intelligent allocation of limited resources through a unique system of activities to outperform the competition.”_ (Note the word _unique_; sameness is death.)
- You create advantage two ways: **do different things**, or **do similar things differently** (keep asking both questions). Most firms that outperform pick a lane and commit.

## What I’ll be stealing

- **Ten strategic thinking skills,** useful as a self-audit and a team hiring rubric.
  1.  Strategy
  2.  Insight
  3.  Context
  4.  Competitive
  5.  Value
  6.  Resource
  7.  Modeling
  8.  Innovation
  9.  Purpose
  10. Mental Agility
- **Insight sources**: Context, Customers, Questions, Models (CCQM). If you don’t reserve _calendar time_ for insight, you won’t get any (the book even cites execs who block “think time”).
- **Value disciplines**: pick one (Product Leadership, Operational Excellence, or Customer Intimacy) and let it cascade into everything.
  - Straddle two? Enjoy mediocrity.
- **Strategy Filter**: pre-agreed criteria for what gets resources (purpose, business design, strategy fit, impact).
  - Say “no” faster; say “yes” with receipts.
- **G.O.S.T. without mush**: Goal, Objective, Strategy, Tactic—stop mixing them. Then pressure-test execution against the five failure modes (faulty strategy, unclear resourcing, poor communication, weak accountability, no calibration).

---

## Trade-offs

- Resources come in three flavors—tangible, intangible, human—and not all are equal.
- To anchor a strategy, resource must be hard to copy, generate customer value, be sustainable, and lack easy substitutes.
  - Translation: protect the crown jewels (brand, talent, proprietary capabilities) and prune the rest.

## My 7-day playbook

- **Day 1–2 — Context scan:** run an OODA loop on market, customer, competitor, and company; sketch two models (Five Forces and SWOT/Opportunity Matrix). Deliver _one_ provocative insight per area.
- **Day 3 — Choose a value discipline:** pick _one_ (product, cost, or solution) and write the consequences (what we double down on; what we stop).
- **Day 4 — Draft the Strategy Filter:** 6–8 criteria aligned to purpose, business design, strategy, impact; socialize and adopt.
- **Day 5 — StrategyPrint v1:** one-pager of WHAT/HOW/WHO/IMPACT plus an Activity System Map. (Force connections from tactics back to strategy; kill or fix or fund accordingly.)
- **Day 6 — Resource audit:** map key resources to the four tests (hard to copy, value, sustainable, no substitutes).
- **Day 7 — Tune-up cadence:** put a recurring “strategy tune-up” on the calendar (weekly/biweekly); debate with data; assign owners; close the loop.

---

## Favorite frameworks

- **Strategy Design (7 prompts):** Purpose, Value, Context, Who, What, How, Advantage. (Yes, in that order.)
- **Strategy = Acumen → Allocation → Action:** ask daily: _What’s the key insight? Where will we focus? How will we win?_
- **Insight = info × info (non-obvious):** if an “insight” doesn’t change a decision, it’s a restatement, not an insight.

## Why "Deep Dive"

Most strategy books admire problems; _Deep Dive_ arms operators. It’s relentlessly practical, anti-buzzword, and structurally simple enough to teach your team; then hold them to it. If you’re stepping into leadership (or founder mode), this is the upgrade.

_PS: I’m starting a series for books like this—non-tech on the surface, but rich with operational leverage._
