## Increase Product Velocity

- Old idea; a good executive is a busy executive.
  - New idea is that the engineers are busy and are the core decision makers, rather than relying on top down ideas.
- Open AI has the opportunity to build _the_ internet platform that will organize agents and their access of the internet.
  - Considers GPT (product) excellent due to the underlying model.

## Compete Against Open AI

- Their focus is to be the core model used by the world, and some of the tie-in products (_GPT_), but there will be API or SDK options for other organizations to build upon.

### Capital Investment Round

- **Master Plan:** "... try to make great models, and ship good products ..."
- Sam believes in tackling the problems in front of you, but doesn't believe it's effective to try and backwards plan a path to an ultimate goal.
  - He knows that AI infrastructure needs to be increased substantially
  - But he thinks Open AI's competitive advantage is in being nimble and willing to pivot based on feedback.
  - Believes they'll continue to make great models, and will make good products.
    - But they only focus on one or two steps at a time, not long master plans.
    - He thinks master planners never succeed.

## Issues with Monolithic Companies

- Every tech revolution the small companies disrupt the proven giants. (_Think IBM_)
  - Organizations get bogged down by their processes and lack the ability to adjust..
- A couple of years left of the monoliths fighting against the change, and then mad scramble at the end to try to adjust, (_but by then small startups will have won market share and in turn grow into monoliths themselves_).
- 20 year-old using GPT vs a 30 year-old.
  - Youth adapts faster
  - The youth use it as an operating system, and memorize long prompts that they use for patterned cases.
  - They use GPT as a personal advisor for major life decisions.
  - Older people use GPT as a google replacement
  - 30's as an advisor
  - college students and younger use it as an operating system.

### How is Open AI using it

- "It writes a lot of our code."
  - Doesn't know the exact number.
  - Doesn't think the number of lines matters, and is a dumb metric
    - "It's writing meaningful code." and thinks that's what matters/should be measured.

## Given consumer is main revenue center; Why keep API in 10 years?

- Sam hopes that all AI agents and services will merge into "one thing", with the ability to log in with Open AI and then use the new internet.
- He thinks/hopes there will be a new protocol comparable to HTTP for the future of AI agents. (_obviously wants Open AI in the middle of it. Are they making plays to be rent seekers?_)

## AI needs more data; Will it get sensor data?

- People are already doing that for their own use cases, and new models are processing that data better than they ever have before.
- Open AI will bake it in at some point, but not clear exactly when/which model.

## Voice Model

- They believe it's vital, and are working on it, but acknowledge they've not done well enough yet.
  - Mentioned that chat took a while for them to crack too.
  - Thinks voice GUI is a barrier.
  - Voice will create a whole new class of devices.

## Coding Focus for Open AI

- They view it as a central aspect of the model, and they'll continue to develop toward that direction\.
  - They want to create the models that will take prompt input and deliver full programs "complete"
- Their API will continue to assist developers, but they want GPT to be able to deliver a program.
- Chat -> Agents -> full programs delivered

## Underrated Ingredient to Future AI Models

- The highest leverage is still algorithms improvement, data, and compute.

## Coordinate Moonshot Projects

- Some massive projects require top down leadership, but in general they operate as a research lab.
- Before day one, they spent a lot of time researching and designing what a "well-run research lab looks like."
  - They had to go really far in the past.
    - As in nearly everyone who was last involved in a good research lab was actually dead, and not available for direct input.
- They follow the principles they found in the historical great labs.
  - Labs that are diverging continue to fall behind/fail.

## Humanities Breakthroughs

- They have academic research departments they partner with to assist.
- But their main breakthrough is in making the model ubiquitous and as cost efficient as possible. Thus democratizing access, for anyone who wants to conduct the research on their own.
  - _Are we entering a new enlightenment where the discoveries are available to anyone with the curiosity to explore?_
- "90% thrust vector" is focused on improving the models and delivering access to everyone.

## Platonic Ideal State

- Tiny reasoning model with a trillion tokens of context.
  - The model never updates, but it's able to recall everything you put into across your entire life and reasons with you.
    - Would cover every conversation of your life, every book you read, every data input from any source (film, audio, etc...), and life continue to append indefinitely.

## Value Creation 12 Month Horizon

- Building infrastructure
- Better Models
- API or method to integrate models
- Sam thinks 2025 is the year that agents start doing a predominant amount of work; especially around coding (a few others too)
- 2026 AI makes novel major discoveries in the sciences.
  - Science discovery is the real driver of economic growth as entrepreneurs/businesses discover methods of implementing those discoveries for market use.
- 2027 is where robots create and drive value.

## Closing Thoughts

- O3 is likely as smart as or smarter than the audience.
- Resilience gets easier over time.
  - Challenges get harder, but the emotional toil gets easier.
- The challenge isn't in the moment of the event.
  - It's in managing the fallout after the challenge is overcome.
  - Crisis control is valuable, but dealing with aftermath is the vital skill. Day 60 after is the real challenge.
