This feels like one of those rare “before and after” moments in tech.

We’re already past the inflection point.

## Deployment Has Entered the Acceleration Phase

Q1 of 2025 was when the lid popped off. AI agent adoption isn’t something theoretical anymore. It’s shipping.

At scale!

Enterprises are no longer piloting agents in the corner of a department; they’re turning entire workflows over to autonomous systems and training staff to collaborate with them.

We’re seeing agent deployment go from “experimental edge case” to “standard tooling,” and it’s moving faster than expected. The shift is no longer about _whether_ companies will integrate agents.

It's about how quickly they can reskill staff to partner with them.

## The Economics of Token Use: Cheaper Models, Exploding Demand

Each new model brings with it cheaper inference. Tokens cost less. Running large language models is more affordable than it was six months ago, and costs are continuing to drop.

But it’s not slowing demand down, it's accelerating it!

Companies aren’t spending less; they’re getting far more for their budget. With each improvement in price-performance, total revenue for model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google is growing at breakneck speed. Think internet-adoption-era curves. That level of scale.

## The New Corporate Priority: Workforce Retraining

There’s a noticeable shift happening inside corporate walls. Especially in mid-to-large enterprises. IT teams aren’t the only ones talking about prompts and agent behaviors anymore. HR, operations, finance—everyone is being asked to upskill.

Executives are investing in retraining programs specifically aimed at helping non-technical staff interact with agents.

The goal is to shift staff from passive users of tools to active collaborators with AI. These agents aren’t assistants in the “chatbot” sense anymore. They’re coworkers, taking on actual knowledge work.

## The Architecture Bottleneck: Only 22% Are Ready

While demand is exploding and talent is being reoriented, the actual infrastructure capable of fully supporting agent-based workflows is still rare. Just 22% of surveyed organizations had architecture ready to support this at scale.

They’ve got the tools, but the workflows are brittle and non-native. That’s not sustainable.

Either the architecture evolves, or those companies get left behind.

## The Benchmark That Changed Everything

> "On an internal benchmark designed to evaluate model performance on complex, economically valuable knowledge-work tasks, ChatGPT agent's output is comparable to or better than that of humans in roughly half the cases across a range of task completion times, while significantly outperforming o3 and o4-mini." — OpenAI

I’ll let that quote stand on its own, but it speaks volumes about the current state of play—and where things are heading.
