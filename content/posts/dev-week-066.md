## SARAH: Story Analysis & Revision AI Helper

Hired a frontend developer to take what I managed to hack together and turn it into a proper site. First thing she did was throw out my JS and rebuild using a proper React Framework. We're not ready to show it off, but the progress has been amazing. We have light mode and dark mode, and it's been optimized for mobile.

Though, we're at a pause point as I figure out the backend infrastructure.

Originally I'd planned to say screw it and launch on a PaaS; however, fate other plans! I've gotten so lucky and found a CTO who shares my enthusiasm, knows precisely how to structure our infrastructure without encoring thousands in cloud fees, and best of all has extensive experience with data integrity and security.

SARAH is so back on track, and no longer a moonshot idea in my mind, but a full fledged SaaS. Alpha feedback has been phenomenal, and best of all is the price point is being raved about because I've managed to solve a serious need in the publishing industry for pennies on the dollar.

After strategizing with my CTO there is now a realistic plan to train our own model and own our own mote! SARAH is not longer a small software tool, but a realistic contender at craving out our piece of the 2026 Agent Wars.
