## New Discord Server

If you're looking for a small Discord server of fellow developers, you're welcome to join Dev Lounge: https://discord.gg/36seS7sH The long term goal is to turn the group into a tightknit community of developers who are excited to learn and want to help uplift those around them.

## NovelFoundry

SARAH is now being rolled into a full fledged SaaS known as [NovelFounry](https://www.facebook.com/NovelFoundry). I've gone head and updated all the tags for the past posts about SARAH to make it easier for those interested in reading about the evolution from an in house CLI tool for Aconite Cafe to a modernized software suite for indie authors and small publishing houses.

The website design is done and ready to launch, I'm just need to finalize the backend architecture. We're presently debating if we should launch scrappy or design for rapid expansion. In the meantime, if you're interested in joining the alpha team to test the software you can sign up here: [aconitecafe.com/developmentalediting/](https://aconitecafe.com/developmentalediting/)

Else, keep reading here and for updates as the launch progresses. Site should be live sometime next week, and we'll open up the software to the public as soon as we get the majority vote from the alpha team. I'd rather maintain the alpha testing longer than open up the beat early and leave a poor first impression. Given the market competition it's crucial we launch with all the foreseeable platform bugs worked out. As the sole software developer I suspect this will take all of December.

Also leading into the beta launch, I'll conduct a small advertising campaign. If possible, I'd like to double our userbase in the first week and stress test the platform infrastructure. Toward that end, We've gone ahead and begun the first phase of building out an author newsletter for NovelFoundry. (_These dev logs are going to start including more write ups about the marketing side of launching a SaaS._)

It's been a crazy couple of weeks, so I apologize for the lack of articles and updates. Once we launch and stabilize, I should have time to write up more technical posts that dive into the nuts and bolts of how we accomplished everything. If there's anything specific you'd like me to cover, please post in the above discord server and I'll do my best.
