##### 10.4.0 Drawing Some Lines

Learned the difference between `self.variable` and `self.__variable`

**GPT**

> The choice between `self.__variable` and `self.variable` in Python class design reflects **intentions around visibility, encapsulation, and internal use**.

- `self.variable` â€“ **Public attribute**
- `self._variable` â€“ **Protected (by convention only)**
- `self.__variable` â€“ **Private (name-mangled)**

I think I was supposed to know this already, but clearly forgot.

#### 11. Learn Memory Management (26/101 modules)

##### 11.2.3

In C, splitting code into files likeÂ `coord.c`,Â `coord.h`, andÂ `main.c`Â is a practice calledÂ **modular programming**. Hereâ€™s how each file serves a distinct purpose:

###### `coord.h`Â (Header file):

This file declares the structures and function prototypes (signatures) of your coordinate utilities. By including it in other files, the compiler knows about your types and functionsâ€”even if their actual implementation is somewhere else.  
_For example, it tells the compiler â€œthereâ€™s a function calledÂ `scale_coordinate`Â that returns aÂ `struct Coordinate`."_

###### `coord.c`Â (Implementation file):

This implements (defines) the functions declared inÂ `coord.h`. All the logicâ€”the instructions for struct manipulation and coordinate mathâ€”lives here.  
By separating this from the header, you can change how functions work without breaking code that calls them, as long as you keep the interface the same.

###### `main.c`Â (Driver/test file):\*\*

This is the entry point: it contains theÂ `main()`Â function and any code to run your program or tests. It relies on the declarations inÂ `coord.h`Â and the real code inÂ `coord.c`.

###### Why does C do this?

- It keeps code organized and easier to maintain.
- It allows teams to work on different parts independently.
- It helps prevent "duplicate symbols" and other compilation errors.

###### In summary:

- Header files declareÂ *what*Â exists,
- Implementation files defineÂ *how*Â things work,
- Main (or other) files use these pieces to create the program's behavior.
