## NeetCode Algorithms and Data Structures for Beginners (progress 25/35)

Progress has been slow and steady, but I'm back at it full time and will push forward with gusto. The first few days returning were rough, but I quickly fell back into the groove and realized how much I've missed the puzzle solving aspect of programming.

### NeetCode 150 (progress 21/150)

Generally I can solve the easy problems on my own, and the occasional medium. However, my solution is often far from the optimal. More than once I've managed a "working" solution only for it to time out because my big O is off. It's a tad discouraging, but I'm reassuring myself that with time, dedication, and practice it'll work itself out.

When I move onto the next course, I'll circle back and resolve the leetcode problems daily until I can deeply understand the patterns underlining the algorithm implementation, and ideally write an easy solution in <5 minutes and a medium solution in <10 minutes. At which point I'll consider the concept solved. _Unless I'm writing a memorized solution to the exact answer._

Obviously I should understand the basic algorithm, _such as BFS_, and be able to write it instantly, but most of the problems require some level of modification. And if I end up memorizing that solution, rather than core algorithm and pattern recognition, that would not count as solved.

## Day Job

I've reached another pause point for the next month, and will be able to dedicate 30+ hours a week toward programming.
