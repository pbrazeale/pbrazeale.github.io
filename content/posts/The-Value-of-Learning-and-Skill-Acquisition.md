## Assumptions:

1. You work on average 2,000 hours/year.
2. You make $70,000/year.

   - Or $35/hour.

3. A new skill requires 500 hours to acquire.

   1. And that skill will increase your earnings by a 25%:
      - $8.75/hour
      - $17,500/year

4. This skill will remain valid for 10 years.
5. It's all or nothing.
   - Meaning 499 hours = 0% increase in earnings.

_There are 168 hours in a week_.

- 50 hours go toward work
- 56 hours go toward sleep/rest
- 62 hours for you to allocate

## Argument:

1. The skill value is $175,000 over ten years.
   - $175,000 / 500 hours and you get expected value of $350/hour.

Or put another way, you'll earn 10X per hour invested in the skill (_assuming you finish_) compared to your work hour.

1. Apply that same logic a second time, only this skill requires 800 hours:
   1. New base salary $87,500, or $43.75/hour
   2. New yearly salary $109,375 or $54.69/hour
   3. New Skill value = $218,750 or $273/hour

_Less per hour True._
In absolute terms:

- It's still a 25% increase.
- Or a 56% increase over the starting salary.
  - _That 6.25% compounded increase is the real magic!_

3. 500 hours across 6 months:

   - 83.33/hours per month
   - 19.23/hours per week
   - 2.74/hours per day

4. 800 hours across 12 months:
   - 66.66/hours per month
   - 15.38/hours per week
   - 2.19/hours per day

## Conclusion:

You have at least 60 hours per week to use for:

- Relationships
- Entertainment
- Self-Mastery

Split them evenly, and you have **20 hours per week for Self-Mastery**.

_What skill will you master next?_
