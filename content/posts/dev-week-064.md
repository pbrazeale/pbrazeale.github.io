### SARAH: Story Analysis & Revision AI Helper

This week I focused on gathering alpha feedback from fellow publishers about SARAH’s outputs. So far, impressions are positive.

Pricing is still a work-in-progress, but every projection I’ve run shows strong ROI within 90 days—and even guaranteed profits in the first 30, based on my current audience. That’s about the best outcome I could hope for on a first SaaS launch.

I'm also gearing up for the website launch: writing articles, recording tutorials, and pushing through QA.

I’ll meet with my mentor Tuesday to finalize the launch date. I'm still aiming for the 17th, but depending on his thoughts, and alpha tester feedback, it could shift. As long as I launch before Thanksgiving, I’m in good shape.

Writers have a tradition of NaNoWriMo (trying to write a full novel in November). Launching before then positions SARAH perfectly for both waves: the hundreds of first drafts in December in need of strong development feedback, along with January resolutions as newer writers attempt to become authors for the first time, and likewise need development feedback.

Altering the agents to provide tailored feedback for first time authors is the last feature I want before the launch, but it can also be coded up and tested in November.

## Work Log

My entire week was marketing; editing articles for our marketer, and writing out the SOPs for our Director of Admin to take over the day-to-day monitoring and reporting of our marketing efforts. Most of my focus was on preparing for a test run next week, where I'll step back some to let our marketer hit the KPIs on his own, and offer feedback as to where his performance lands.

Main goal is to go full hands off on the 13th in preparation for the handoff to our director on the 17th. I'm looking forward to going back to a full-time developer.

Until then I'm using this opportunity to demonstrate my ability to breakdown a complex problem, with zero outside input, and deliver measurable performance increase, and mentor others to take over. My hope is this will stand out and prove that my engineering potential is even higher than what's currently perceived, as it'll show I'm capable of taking on senior level responsibility.
