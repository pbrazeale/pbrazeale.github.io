[AI Engineering by Chip Huyen](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/)

## Preface

- In **2012**, the AlexNet authors noted:
  > “All of our experiments suggest that our results can be improved simply by waiting for faster GPUs and bigger datasets to become available.”
- Papers about LLMs early as the 1950s.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) built upon retrieval technology that powers search and recommender systems.
- She also wrote **Designing Machine Learning Systems** which has other insights that will prove valuable.
- **This book is not a tutorial.**
- The book is laid out to follow the lifecycle of building an AI application.
- Model evaluation is the hardest part of AI Engineering.
- The last chapter will bring everything together to cover building an AI application end-to-end.
-

### Three key model response levers:

1. "The instructions for how the model should behave"
2. "The context the model can use to respond to the query"
3. "The model itself"
