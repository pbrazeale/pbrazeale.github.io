## Personal Notes

Short form is content is a bunch of small bets without outsized returns for the success. Think startup bets, but for the content space.

Balance and multiplication of the 3 Pillars determines the company value. Think of the balance of book marketing: Genre (distribution potential), Presentation (Conversion rate based on cover and blurb), Retention (sell-through in a series)

Must hear back from users to increase conversion. (Beta Readers)

- Create an ideal user profile. (Same as a reader profile)

When selecting an account to partner with, look for ones that can have a viral 1M+ views for a sponsored video.

Content generation stems from a similar process of selecting a genre and identifying the core tropes to use.

Influences are normal people, and you should send emails and DMs.

- Follow up after 3-5 days after a lack of response.
- Make sure you're able to demonstrate genuine interest in their content and why it would be a good match. Think pitch email to agents/editors for a novel.
- Anything close to 50% response rate is considered good.

Structure your contracts with your influencers so that they're aligned with your metrics.

- Structure your contacts across multiple videos vs a single video.
- Focus on the quality of the conversion not the follower count.

Negotiate by starting with the largest package possible, and then strip out what you don't need.

- When you find a final price based on needed features of the posts, then negotiate from that price on discounted rate ~30% for a bulk order.

Start with 30-60 short form posts to find metrics and trends to track.

- Higher view count doesn't always lead to higher conversion. It's more important to hit the correct audience than splatter your content to the widest possible audience and hope for conversion.
- Think about how a book is positioned in the market with a cover, and then the blurb converts the right readers by making tone and trope promises.

When you find your viral video, turn it into a series; same as converting a successful trilogy into a long series. Raymond E. Feist.

### User Conversation Engine

- **Critical First Step**: Understand users through:
  - Direct interviews (power users & refund requests)
  - Surveys and NPS tracking
  - Analyzing user behavior patterns
- **Key Questions**:
  - Where do users hang out online?
  - What language do they use?
  - What content do they consume?

### The 3-Step Process For Going Viral

- **Gather Ingredients** (Research)
- **Explore & Create** (Experimentation)
- **Exploit** (Scale winners)

### Step1

- Create "user persona" social accounts
- Reverse-engineer user FYP (For You Page) algorithm
- Track competitors' successful content
- Build influencer spreadsheet with metrics:
  - Viral ceiling (not follower count)
  - Audience alignment
  - Conversion potential

### Step2. Explore Before You Exploit

- **Know Your Audience** – Study their interests and content preferences.
- **Viral Content is Unpredictable** – No guaranteed formula for instant success.
- **Experimentation is Key** – Test different influencers and content styles.
- **Expect Failures** – Some content will flop; learn and refine.
- **Minimize Growing Pains** – Leverage insights from past experiences.

### Create a List of Content Ideas

- **Leverage Influencer Content** – Analyze what influencers your users follow, what works for them, and why.
- **Study Competitors** – Look at similar tools and brands to see what content performs well.
- **Use Social Media Algorithms** – Scroll through relevant feeds to identify attention-grabbing content.
- **Refine Your Hooks** – Identify why certain content catches your attention and adapt it for your audience.

### Working With Influencers

**Test Variables for Influencers**

- Talent: influencers → friends → you
- Hooks: 3s rule, text vs spoken
- Tech: pacing/lighting, multi-accounts (new SIMs)
- Platforms: Cross-post (remove watermarks)

### User-Generated Content (UGC)

- **UGC is reliable** – Posting 20–30 videos monthly allows for failures.
- **Deal structure** – ~$2,000/month base + performance incentives (views, sales, redemptions).
- **Incentives matter** – Prevents low-effort content and keeps creators engaged.
- **UGC vs. Influencers** – Big budget? Use influencers. Small budget? Start with UGC.
- **Fast feedback loops** – Content success is clear within 24 hours, enabling quick iteration and scaling.

### Short-Form Posting Strategy

- **Post Everywhere** – Share content across Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts to maximize reach.
- **Native Optimization** – Remove watermarks and customize hooks/text on each platform for better engagement.
- **High Volume** – Start with 30–60 daily posts to test and refine what works.
- **Avoid Shadowbans** – Use fresh accounts, avoid mass account creation, and monitor engagement trends.
- **True Virality** – Impactful content converts targeted viewers into loyal users, not just high view counts.

### Step3. Exploit: Turning a Viral Video Into a Series

- **Double Down on Success** – Identify high-performing videos and create variations instead of restarting from scratch.
  - **Minimal Tweaks, Maximum Impact** – Repost with slight changes (e.g., setting, hook, or challenge) to maintain engagement.
  - **Multi-Account Strategy** – Expand reach by posting variations on multiple accounts and across different languages.
  - **Leverage Meme Trends** – Capitalize on viral formats to extend content lifespan.
  - **Monetization Potential** – A single viral series can generate millions of views and substantial revenue.

### Bonus: Scaling Influencer Marketing

- **Focus on Long-Term Deals** – Commit to multi-video, ongoing partnerships to reduce constant negotiations.
- **Build a Team** – Delegate outreach and negotiations using past emails/DMs as training.
- **Leverage Influencer "Nodes"** – Some influencers inspire others to copy them, multiplying exposure.
- **Scale Gradually** – With time, refine strategies and increase spending for higher returns.
- **ROI Potential** – Winning influencer campaigns outweigh losses, delivering strong returns over time.

### Conclusion: Mastering Influencer Marketing

- **Effort & Creativity Pay Off** – Extra effort in finding and negotiating with influencers leads to better deals.
- **Niche Influencers > Big Names** – Smaller influencers often provide better ROI than large creators with agents.
- **Make Ads Organic** – Integrate products into viral series or inside jokes to keep content engaging.
- **Learn & Improve** – Early failures are learning experiences, and one great influencer can offset past losses.
- **Scale Up Success** – Use data from past deals to refine strategies and land more effective partnerships.
