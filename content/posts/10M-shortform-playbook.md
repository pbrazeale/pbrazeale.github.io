## Content Strategy as a Series of Strategic Bets

Short-form content is like making small startup bets—most won’t yield massive returns, but the few that succeed can drive real growth. Think of each piece of content as a micro-experiment. Your goal is to quickly test, measure, and iterate.

## The 3 Pillars of Content Value

Just like book marketing, the value of your content company depends on the balance and multiplication of three key elements:

1. **Genre (Reach):** How wide is the potential distribution?
2. **Presentation (Conversion):** Does your "cover and blurb" (visuals, hook, caption) drive clicks and views?
3. **Retention (Sell-through):** Does your content make people stick around, subscribe, or engage again?

A weakness in one can drag down the others—optimize for balance, not just one metric.

## User Feedback is Crucial

You need real user input to improve conversion—think **beta readers**, but for content.

- Define your _ideal viewer_ the same way you would a _reader profile_ in publishing.
- Track what resonates and what doesn’t. This isn’t optional—feedback loops are what turn average posts into viral ones.

---

## Influencer & Account Selection

Choose influencer accounts like you'd choose a co-author or developmental editor:

- Look for proven viral potential (1M+ views).
- Don’t just chase big followings—**focus on conversion quality**, not just exposure.

---

## Outreach that Converts

Think of influencer outreach like pitching a novel to an agent:

- Send personalized DMs/emails.
- Follow up after 3–5 days if there's no response.
- Make it clear why your collaboration makes sense. Show that you know—and respect—their content.

A 50% response rate is a strong signal you're doing this right.

---

## Smart Contracts & Negotiation

Structure contracts to align with **your key metrics**, not just one-off posts:

- Negotiate bundles—**multiple videos across time** convert better than a one-time post.
- Start with the **largest package**, then remove features you don’t need.
- Once you’ve defined the exact deliverables, negotiate ~30% off for a bulk rate.

---

## Content Testing & Scaling

Begin with **30–60 short-form posts** to gather initial data:

- Track which posts convert vs. just getting views.
- Higher view count ≠ higher conversion. Focus on hitting the **right audience** over the widest one.
- Think of positioning like a book cover: It gets attention. Then the blurb (tone + tropes) convinces the reader to buy.

## Turn Virality into a Series

When something works—**double down**.  
If you find a viral video, **turn it into a series**, just like a successful trilogy becomes a long-running saga. (Think Raymond E. Feist.)
