[The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google by Scott Galloway](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34427200-the-four)

## Notes

- **Amazon** = distribution + logistics as destiny (the warehouse is the product; the flywheel is the moat).
- **Apple** = brand + vertical control (hardware-software-services trifecta; margins as a design choice).
- **Facebook** (Meta) = attention brokerage (identity graph; micro-targeting; network effects that refuse to die).
- **Google** = intent capture (default positions + index scale → money printer with research attached).

- **ROI > rhetoric**: cost of capital, margin structure, LTV/CAC (Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost), and the boredom of ops; that’s where the money hides.
- **Moats are built, not announced**: distribution, data, and operations compound; “brand” is just the exhaust from promises kept (over and over).
- **Incentives explain behavior**: ads, defaults, CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) in logistics. Change the incentives; change the outcomes.

## How I’ll use it

1. **Ship distribution first**
   1. Before features, secure channels: search rank, partnerships, logistics, default positions (distribution beats clever).
2. **Design flywheels, not dashboards**
   1. Behavior → feedback → ranking → conversion → cheaper acquisition
   2. Loops that learn without extra hands.
3. **Brand = operational promise**
   1. Speed, reliability, after-purchase support
   2. Position less, deliver more.
4. **Default or die**
   1. Be the easiest acceptable option (one-click, auto-fill, “arrives tomorrow”)
   2. Convenience compounds.
5. **Start with incentives**
   1. Align payoffs to desired behavior
   2. Document guardrails
   3. Assume policy will trail success.
