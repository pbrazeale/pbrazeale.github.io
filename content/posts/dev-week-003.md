## CS50X

### Week 4 (progress 36%)

Filters took me several hours to wrap my mind around the process of navigating the bitmap to then apply the proper filtering algorithm to.

### Online Support

Recover was going well, but when I googled an error I ran into while compiling a reddit post shared a "hint" by displaying the entire code solution \-\_\- so it took the wind out of me that day. Obviously I can't unread it, so it spoiled the learning curve for myself.

Moving forward I'll have to force myself to re-watch lectures and take better notes, to avoid online support. If I wanted to solve the problems as fast as possible, I'd use Chat GPT (_I'm suing Harvard's hosted VS Code for my IDE_)

**RANT OVER**

## Other Research

Instead of watching an episode of TV before bed, I've found myself watching software developers share their physical and digital setups. Neovim desire returns.

I'm now literally racing against my internal motivation to finalize these courses, develop and launch my software, vs the novelty itch to explore Neovim and what pure freedom over my IDE environment would feel like.

Discovering that I can integrate Obsidian directly into Neovim has about sealed the deal for me, but I know if I sidetrack I'm only going to set myself back.

To help scratch the itch, I've begun playing [VIM Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) to get me use to the motions. My next step will be to install the VIM Motions plugin for VS Code. (_Thank you The Primeagen for that recommendation_)

## Side Projects

### Job Ready Checklist

Spent a day setting up GitHub, Linked In, This Blog, and I'm sure something else that was on the checklist. (_It was reworking my resume to use active verbs explaining my responsibilities running Aconite Cafe and highlighting the technical aspects I've been over._)

### Day Job

It's been a long week. The day job required more dedication this week ramping up for a launch, but come the 8th, that'll subside and I'll be back to full-focus.

### First Interview

Applied for to join a cohort of CS college graduates for an interviewing bootcamp. The objective was to whip the participants into shape for the technical portion and ensure they have the soft skills to pass the behavioral. (_Call it hubris, but I'm not concerned with my soft skills._)

The cohort was filled by time I applied, so I sent an email explaining my mission, and showcasing how far I've come with only half a month of epicene. Not sure if it was the technical accomplishments in a short timeframe, or the fact that I built Aconite Cafe, but the instructor (_a YouTuber you may know_) opened a slot in his calendar for the next afternoon to interview me.

Of course I was thrilled and flattered. I'd heard "Apply Early" when it comes to positions, and while this wasn't a job, it was a position meant to be filled by a CS graduate...

Long story short, I turned down the slot because it was a payment up front, despite being advertised as no payment upfront but only after the guaranteed job position.

Excellent experience, and I'm grateful I put myself out there. I even hope to work with the instructor in the future. However, the bait and switch rubbed me the wrong way and cost me a productive evening.
