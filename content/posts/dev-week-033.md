## Projects

### 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (27/100)

#### Day 024 Mail Merge

Excellent project. I can already see how using this to rename filenames throughout a dir would be helpful.

**Major takeaway:** windows makes reading the files tedious since I have to `\\` each provided `\` when copying a relative path. I need to finalize my Linux setup and then I can practice git pull and starting fresh on new system on an established codebase.

#### Day 025 U.S. States Game

Built a quiz game using turtle and pandas.

Learned the _basics_ of pandas, and can already see the advantages over an excel sheet that I'm accustomed to.

#### Day 027 Tkinter

Built GUI Miles to Km converter using Tkinter.

Built a working final project without watching the video. Grid system makes placement easy! Updated km formula from 1.6 to 1.609.

### HP Z440 (Home Server)

Bought a used HP Z440:

- 1TB NVME
- 64GB DDR4
- Xeon E5-2680
- Nvidia 8800 GT

#### Goals:

1. Pick a Linux Distro that allows for, and easy application control panel.
   1. Leaning toward Proxmox based on initial research.
2. Create a dedicated VM for running through the LPIC-1 course work.
3. Explore Docker and Kubernetes (in the future).
4. Create a dedicated Jellyfin server to stream our DVDs at home.
   1. Have already begun the ripping and backup process.
5. Tinker with Linux and have fun.

### NeetCode SQL for Beginners (75/75)

While I now understand the basics, and have an excellent reference guide in my notes, I'll still need hands on practice:

1. building a database from scratch
2. automating data cleaning
3. using pandas and matplotlib

### Linux Journey Grasshopper (2/8)

https://linuxjourney.com/

Dropping this for now. The books are working well enough when paired with hands on tinkering.

### Books

**The Linux Command Line by William Shotts** (144/594)

**How Linux Works by Brian Ward** (189/366)

**LPIC-1 Exam 101** (11/554)

As soon as I wrap up How Linux Works, I'll dive into this prep work and then schedule my exam. Based on current progress, I expect to take the exam next month, and 102 within a month afterward. Once I setup the home server and explore the section exercises, I'll have a better assessment of where I'm at.
