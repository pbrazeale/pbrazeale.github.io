### Boot.Dev Back-end Developer Career Path (~58.27%) (ðŸ“ˆ +4.75%)

Crushed this week and feeling a bit burnt after balancing everything, but so worth it!

The AI Agent project is the best thing I've ever built and I learned so much! Given that the whole reason I took up programming was to assist in the AI integration transformation, this was the first week where I finally felt like I achieved a major milestone toward that specific objective.

Learning to become a better developer is important and interesting, but it's building the AI agents and starting to see how the piece fit together for me to develop a solution for others that has reignited my initial fire that drove me last year.

I'M BACK!

#### 11.Â Learn Memory Management (68/101)

I'm going to place this course on hold, and return to it at the end, if needed. But for now I'll move forward with Go and all the other courses. My main objective is to learn enough to build a SaaS that leverages AI to assist authors.

#### 13.Â Learn Go (49/188)

I can already see why Go is so popular. It's most of the benefits of C without the manual memory management and the syntax is cleaner. Overall great course thus far, per usual.
