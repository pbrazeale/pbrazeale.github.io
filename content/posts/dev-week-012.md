## NeetCode 150 (progress 6/150)

I'm following the [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) 150 Raodmap, starting with the easies and working my through to prepare for leetcode and in turn interviews.

### Data Structures & Algorithms

I'm enrolling in [UCSanDiegoX: Data Structures Fundamentals](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-structures/the-university-of-california-san-diego-data-structures-fundamentals) and [UCSanDiegoX: Algorithmic Design and Techniques](https://www.edx.org/learn/algorithms/the-university-of-california-san-diego-algorithmic-design-and-techniques) likewise to assist further.

## ALGS200X (progress )

### Algorithmic Design and Techniques

ETA: 6 weeks (8â€“10 hours per week)

Made it through the first week, but the link to the textbook was broken. Realized that NeetCode offers a subscription to courses, first of which is Data Structures & Algorithms. Going to pay for it and work my through it instead.

## NeetCode Algorithms and Data Structures for Beginners (progress 5/35)

Working my way through the lectures and progressing through the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/pbrazeale/) problems. I still need to complete another 15-20 problems to solidify the lessons, but I've made decent progress and I'm starting to visualize the pattern.

Overall the instructions and course breakdown is excellent. I'll hold off until the end before passing final judgment of the course overall, but I'm pleased thus far.
