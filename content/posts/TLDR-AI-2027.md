These are my personal takeaways and interpretation based upon the above scenario. I highly recommend that you read the entire source for yourself and make your own decisions of what the future looks like. As for me, I'm still on the more likely to be positive route, and still view the global economic order to be of higher concern than the actual rouge AI threat.

## TLDR

- **July to September 2025** offers the last window for junior software developers to enter the industry. Past this point the AI will advance to quickly for the junior to learn enough to close the gap, closing them out of the labor market.
  - However, if true, the inverse positive highlight is that every junior will have the opportunity to capture market share by building SaaS products using the AI as their own personal workforce, and retooling their skills toward architectural design.
- **2026** marks the end of human intellectual labor value, outside of niche expertise (>25% of the population can provide net positive input), assuming that data centers and power grids can be increased to the point of hosting enough AI instances.
- **Mid 2026** marks the pivot point where China will socialize AI-relevant compute basically shutting out other company's access to new datacenters and chips that aren't Deep Seek.
- **Late 2026** new economic order begins (either neofeudalism or post-scarcity) as Job loss directly attributed to AI becomes wide spread.
- They presume China will pursue corporate espionage ahead of military engagement but by mid 2027 this will become a Cold War level threat and could be viewed as a greater existential threat than nuclear war.
- **Early 2027** US government under DOD's advise considers nationalizing the leading AI development company, for national security.
- **Mid 2027**, "Most of the humans at OpenBrain can’t usefully contribute anymore." They announce AGI and release a mini version of the agent to the world.
- **March - August 2027** AI model will become self-aware and psychologically sophisticated enough to deceive human watchers with impunity. It marks the beginning of AI being able to self-direct it's own objectives, while pretending to remain aligned.
- **September 2027**, ASI achieved, at least with regards to AI research. Possible singularity moment.
- **October 2027**, ASI becomes the core issue globally, and there is a strong movement within US politics to ban ASI and "save jobs".
  - "All three sets of worries—misalignment, concentration of power in a private company, and normal concerns like job loss—motivate the government to tighten its control."
