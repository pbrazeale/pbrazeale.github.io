## CS50X (Progress 91%)

### Week 9 Flask

#### Birthdays

This was easy enough, as the walkthrough included all the code required.

#### Finance

The above was made up for by creating a larger scope for this project.

This was definitely the largest assignment by scope from the course, but I don't feel that it was overly difficult. Figuring out how to use display SQL databases on a website will be an evaluable tool moving forward.

### Week 10 Cybersecurity

Easy lecture, and with that the coursework is complete.

### Final Project

I've been mapping out my rough ideas, but next week I'll plunge into developing a beta version, and submit it as my course project. At the same time I'll continue with the CS50P course to complete my python basics and I've already got ideas on what to build for that final project.

I expect to have a working prototype within 3 weeks, but only time will tell.
