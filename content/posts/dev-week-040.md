## Courses

Met with my mentor on Tuesday, and he advised that I double down on [Boot.Dev](Boot.Dev) to solidify my backend knowledge and focus entering the industry that way to work my way into DevOps.

First impressions are very positive and I thoroughly enjoy the structure of the course, which uses similar psychological reinforcements to popular video games to make the learning process more addictive. _Not sure I needed further motivation, but it can't hurt._

I've placed everything else on hold to focus entirely on this course.
