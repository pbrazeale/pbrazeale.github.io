## Assessment Test (11/30) ~37%

Great thing I have this book, and a few extra study materials. However, for a blind test going into it, I'm okay with my score. Especially if I count the partial answers. This will be fun.

### Correct

1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29

- 1 is only partial, guessed born (thinking BASH Bourne Again SHell?), never heard of dash
- 13 is only partial, didn't choose network server (forgot about terminals LOL)
- 15 only knew systemd, never heard of SysVinit
- 21 guessed `ntpd` so not sure it could count.
- 23 knew ip didn't know `nmtui`
- 29, knew Port directive, didn't guess `Protocol directive`, `PermitRootLogin directive`

### Incorrect

1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30

Mostly I didn't guess where I had no idea, rather than get randomly lucky and score extra points. No point skewing a practice test. If anything a lower score just shows greater progress at the end.

Don't know if I should count the partials as all wrong, or give myself some points, so I counted them in both columns and wound up with a 47%, but for note purposes, I logged partials as a full no in the top score.
