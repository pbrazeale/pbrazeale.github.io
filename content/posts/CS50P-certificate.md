## Harvard Online CS50 Python

## Takeaways

I'm exceptionally grateful to Harvard for allowing the course to be offered for free online, to David J. Malan for his excellent lecturing skills, to
Carter Zenke for the supplementary videos for the lectures, and to everyone else involved in the production and distribution of the course.

While I know there is still much to learn and many more milestones on the road to competency; I am confident that this course has prepared me to build real world software to solve tangible problems. My final project being a prime example. Though it may be rough, it does solve the underlining issue of gathering the KDP Reports data into a centralized database and displaying an accurate Sales/Earnings chart.

Having built my first "real" piece of software taught me so much, and I already see a multitude of ways I can improve. If/when I revisit the software, I'll rebuild it using new libraries/frameworks to create a self-encapsulated software for myself and others to use. Already I'm looking toward Electron to rebuild the entire software in JavaScript and expand upon the functions.

This certificate marks the first of many to come, but the first achievement is always the hardest.

“First, have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end.”
― Aristotle

“success is simple. First, you decide what you want specifically; and second, you decide you’re willing to pay the price to make it happen—and then pay that price.”
