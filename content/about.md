## Digital Craftsman (Developer/Author/Publisher)

I’m an AI Engineer who ships production-grade agentic systems that cut workload and cost. I work where LLM foundation models meet operations: structured pipelines, deterministic fallbacks, tight evals, and guardrails. Teams I work alongside get outcomes, not demos.

I've built and scaled customer support agents for order status, returns, SKU availability, complaints triage, and VIN checks. integrated with Replyco, Discord, OpenAI, and internal APIs. Presently resolving ~40% of all requests end-to-end, with zero human input. I've also shipped a Python + OpenAI content system: ~80,000 Schema.org-compliant descriptions in under 10 hours
