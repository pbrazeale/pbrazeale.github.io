## AI Engineer & Publisher (Engineer/Author/Publisher)

AI Engineer & Publisher who went from author → prompt engineer → AI engineer; I build LLM-powered, production-grade customer-service agents with measurable ROI. Creator of SARAH—editorial software for serious authors.

My stack pairs Python + Litestar APIs with LLMs wired to Replyco, Dialpad, and Discord. Automated evals, deterministic fallbacks, and inference optimization to keep latency/cost in check. Currently deployed agents now resolve ~77% of requests end-to-end (order status, returns, counteroffers, product availability, VIN checks, complaints, warranty eval, etc...) All centralized and controlled by an orchestration agent.

Ask me why Obsidian remains my most valuable developer tool (notes → prompts → shipped systems).
