### Omakub
```
An Omakase Developer Setup for Ubuntu 24.04 by DHH
```
https://omakub.org/

Took the plunge and setup Omakub on my T430. Took three attempts because of dependency glitches, but after a couple of restarts it installed without error and worked fine. Not sure I'm ready to jump into NeoVIM, but thus far I prefer the GUI compared to vanilla Ubuntu.

Of course I stuck with the Tokyo Night theme, but there's several prebuilt to chose from and the prebuilt "default" aspect is the point of Omakub.

A special thanks to [typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2vcIRavtqY) YouTube video about Omakub. Not sure I would have discovered this on my own otherwise. 

## CS50X Final Project
Still in the research phase of using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) to build the desktop application for the eBook formatter.

>**Desktop development made easy**
Electron takes care of the hard parts so you can focus on the core of your application.

[Documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/)
>Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By embedding [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) into its binary, Electron allows you to maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that work on Windows, macOS, and Linux — no native development experience required.
