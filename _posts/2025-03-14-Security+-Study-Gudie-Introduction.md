	- "Percentages have very little meaning when it comes to CompTIA exams. CompTIA has never revealed the point value of the questions or of the performance-based questions. Since they appear to be significantly different, there is no easy way to apply percentage as a meaningful metric."
	- "I got a report from a gent the other day who had one performance-based question and 81 multiple choice. I have also heard reports of seven performance-based questions with multiple choice question counts in the 50s and 60s."

There's plenty of room for improvement, and one was literally my dyslexia. Misread "A.	A dictionary attack" as "directory attack" *LOL*. *Will need to force myself to reread each question and answers.*
