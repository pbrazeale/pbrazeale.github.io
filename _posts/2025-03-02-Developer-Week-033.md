## Projects
### 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (27/100)
#### Day 024 Mail Merge
Excellent project. I can already see how using this to rename filenames throughout a dir would be helpful.

**Major takeaway:** windows makes reading the files tedious since I have to `\\` each provided `\` when copying a relative path. I need to finalize my Linux setup and then I can practice git pull and starting fresh on new system on an established codebase. 

#### Day 025 U.S. States Game
Built a quiz game using turtle and pandas.

Learned the *basics* of pandas, and can already see the advantages over an excel sheet that I'm accustomed to.

#### Day 027 Tkinter
Built GUI Miles to Km converter using Tkinter.

Built a working final project without watching the video. Grid system makes placement easy! Updated km formula from 1.6 to 1.609.
