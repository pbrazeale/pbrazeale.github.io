## CS50P

### Week 5 (progress 60%)

Made it through Week 5 and then switched back to [[CS50]]X

## CS50X

Jumped back over to CS50X now that I have a grasp for programing beyond HTML and CSS _(if you count that sort of thing)_

### Weeks 0 - 3 (progress 27%)

Utilized a free sprite pack from online to establish the assets for Scratch. Realized that I will never have to use that language again.

## Other Research

The distain I felt for scratch carried over into my YouTube exploration at nights. I'm following 5-10 developers now; trying to absorb as much as possible and expand my cognitive map of the craft.

### Neovim

Odd rabbit hole led me to Neovim and a rediscovery of Ubuntu. I played around with it a fair bit in 2008 - 2009 but the lack of compatible software made it impossible as a daily driver, and I've never been exceptionally skilled with the command line _aside from copy pasta_.

However, I think it's The Primeagen who started me down the rabbit hole of Neovim. So much so, that I portioned off a section of my laptop's drive, installed Ubuntu and was about to update Lazy Dubuntu to start with Lazy Vim. _I'm a sucker for Tokyo Night_

Thankfully, calmer minds prevailed and I only lost 6 hours down that rabbit hole.

### VS Code

Don't get me wrong. The moment I accomplish my primary task of building the formatting software, my step will be to explore maximizing my development environment. However, until I'm prepare to wipe my laptop and go full Ubuntu and Neovim, I'll stick with my VS Code and Windows 11.
