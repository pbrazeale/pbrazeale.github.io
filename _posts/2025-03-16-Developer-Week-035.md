## Projects
### 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (37/100)
Fun projects, but because the course is several years old at this point, some of the APIs don't allow for students to use them the same way they did when the course was created. Regardless, the lessons are still informative and good practice.
