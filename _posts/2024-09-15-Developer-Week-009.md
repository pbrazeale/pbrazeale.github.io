### Week 6 File I/O
This was easy but a bit tedious; especially when it came to Shirt and Scourgify to hit the format requirements with zero actional feedback. Took far too long troubleshooting the output to line up with the desired requirements which lacked specifics as to why the output was failing.

Thankfully it's done, and only took about 8 hours for this week's lecture and assignment.

Learned valuable skills for creating and modifying csv files with python. Now sure if I'll use Pillow again, but it seems rather powerful for image modification. (Pillow’s documentation of [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/).)

### Week 7 Regular Expressions
Completed NUMB3RS, and Watch on YouTube problem sets. RE is an interesting module and I can already see how this would be invaluable for cleaning up CSV files for the final project I'll build. 

Only thing left to learn for the Final Project is how to create interactive visual charts to display data analysis. I suspect I'll import CSV files and create a SQL database to store the data and then use SQL queries to format the data relations.
