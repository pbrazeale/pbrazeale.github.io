### Week 7 SQL
[CS50X Week 7 Lecture Notes](https://pbrazeale.github.io/CS50X-Week-7-Lecture-Notes/)
These are by far my most detailed notes I've taken in the course thus far. Instantly when I reached this lecture I felt **jazzed up** and ready to go!

I know data, and databases aren't the flashiest part of programing and software development, but the moment David began to talk about IMDB I knew this was **vital** information I needed. Extrapolating out, I think this week's lecture and course work might have taught me enough to implement my own data management for the software I'm planning.

#### Fiftyville 
The final problem for the week was to solve a mystery using clues from databases. It was highly engaging and really drilled in the repetitions needed to learn my way around SQL. I highly recommend taking a crack at it, as it was fun to solve.

### Week 8 HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Learned a few new things about internet protocols and the barebones of JavaScript.

#### Trivia
This problem was straight forward and easy to setup. I used the [CS50.ai](https://cs50.ai/) to fix syntax issue I ran into, and had to look up a few JavaScript functions, but otherwise it was a breeze. Far less troubleshooting compared to earlier weeks.

#### Homepage
- Integrated bootstrap to create a header and footer section. 
- Utilized JS and jQuery to load the footer for each page from it's own separated html file.
- Spent far too much time formatting text to make it look better.
- Built a css stylesheet to make the site resemble this developer log.


### Week 9 Flask
Watched the lecture [CS50X Week 9 Lecture Notes](https://pbrazeale.github.io/CS50X-Week-9-Lecture-Notes/) and started the first assignment Birthdays.


## Opensource Contribution
I'm in the process of scoping out a larger project I can jump into and offer assistance. My core reason for selecting a larger project is the network size. As I'm still new and unaccustomed to developing in a team, it seems prudent to select a larger project and ideally learn the best practices.

[Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) added to my reading list.

## Git / GitHub
I've been pushing my commits and synchs via VS Code's source control. However, I ran into an issue where I committed a broke styles.scss, and broke the entire site.

After figuring out how to revert the offending commit I also learned, it's best practice to use Git entirely from the command line, and ignore VS Code's source control. 

[Git Docs Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
Alongside reading this, I'm going to take, [HarvardX: Data Science: Productivity Tools](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-productivity-tools) before I begin my final project, just to ensure I can use Git properly, and brushing up on Linux can't hurt. It'll also be a good excuse to finalize my T430's conversion.

- Enrolled; course starts on October, 16th.
