### 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (7/100)
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This came across my feed as a recommendation when I was looking for Python books, and I was able to snag it on sale, so it seemed a no brainer. The simple act of dedicated focus and building projects publicly should prove well worth the price of admission.

#### Day 005
Built a CLI that takes in a password_length between 12 - 20, randomly assigns the number of letters, characters, and symbols. And then randomizes the sequence to produce a randomized password. This was beyond the lesson itself, and really helped to solidify the use of random's built in functions.

#### Day 006
Solved the maze problem with code, using the follow right path algorithm. Gave me flashbacks to the early 2000s and watching the maze screen saver for Windows XP. I need to spend a little time thinking through edge cases. I failed to consider what happens when the robot reached an empty square space, because I didn't encounter it when I tested my code. "Works on my machine" is not an acceptable mindset.
