### 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (17/100)
#### Day 15
Built CLI coffee machine logic.

Managed to build everything but the "off" function without watching the solution. When she went over that requirement, I `import sys` and added a `sys.exit()` call for an "off" request. This was far more engaging than the fist chunk of problems, and I'm finally excited to keep going.

#### Day 017
Built a CLI Quiz Game.
https://github.com/pbrazeale/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main/Day_017_Quiz_Game

Using OOP I created 5 modules. Main, 2 classes: Question, QuizBrain, data, and data2. Using: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php API, I manually downloaded a JSON data structure, cleaned it up and plugged into into the program to update the question_bank.

Overall this was an enjoyable project, and I feel it solidified the OOP concepts covered in the previous lesson.

If you consider taking the course, and have prior python experience (such as CS50P) This is where I'd start.

When it came to the JSON clean up, rather than manually format code, I followed this tutorial and setup and an automatic linter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU3lxjJ0Kbo&t=224s
**Black Formatter** and **isort**

This will carry forward and save me headaches and time.
