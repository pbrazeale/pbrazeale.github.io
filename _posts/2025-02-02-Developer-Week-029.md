## Projects

Built a simple todo list following [Build a Node & Electron Todo App in JUST 15 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOEy18r1OuA) and made it my own by modifying the color scheme and integrating [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) to go off when all tasks are complete. It was a fun and easy way to explore an Electron project start to finish. 

Tinkered with [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/open-source) to build my first AI agent tool using GPT 4o-mini to take in a formatted outline and output a first draft for an email. Ideally I'll develop the tool to the point that it can respond to business emails with little oversight and allow us to process 30+ emails per day in less than an hour.

I also started a tutorial [Intro to React - Build a Kanban Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjrVCY3oPds&t=320s) to familiarize myself with React and Tailwind.
